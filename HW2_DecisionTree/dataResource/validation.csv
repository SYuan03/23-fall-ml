So I started drinking the solution and I was surprised that it was not nearly as awful as what I had expected.  I would drink several swallows of it and then I would drink some lemonade.

My doctor initially prescribed me Xanax to get me through until my antidepressants start working because they don&#039;t have that initial &quot;kick&quot; like Xanax has.

And the only side effect, still is off and on nausea. But I see some people saying the pill won&#039;t work. Some insight.. if Ur ovulating, and have unprotected sex, u obviously have a high chance of pregnancy. With or without this pill. If you read, this pill is supposed to postpone/prevent ovulation so u can&#039;t become pregnant. Therefore, if u do have sex while ovulation, and want to take the pill, it&#039;s risky, but should be taken right after, otherwise may not work.

First of all I bled for all of 4 months straight...I don&#039;t know if breastfeeding had something to do with it but even after the 4 months I was only blood free for a few days at a time. Here I am at 7 months and I&#039;ve been bleeding for going on 3 weeks! I hate it..tried to hang in there but will be calling doctor in the morning!""","November 2, 2017",0,Severe Side Effects,2

90150,Dronabinol,,"""I&#039;ve had chronic pancreatitis for about 7 years. I&#039;ve struggled with nausea and vomiting for so long. Reglan, Scopolamine, Phenargan, Zofran I&#039;ve been on all of them. Yes they worked at first but Marinol is best for me. For the first time in years I&#039;m not sick! I don&#039;t have appetite like some do, it does make me giddy for an hour or 2 but I&#039;m finally not sick at my stomach!""","May 9, 2014",28,Mild Side Effects,5
183644,Cymbalta,Anxiety,"""After years of knowing something was wrong, I went to the doctor and he prescribed Cymbalta. I have been on it for 6 months.  I love it!  I will be married a year in October and my husband and I were already talking divorce until I started Cymbalta.  I did have VERY violent and &#039;goury&#039; dreams when I took it right before bed.  Now I take it in the morning, my dreams are back to normal.  I am currently taking 60mg, but am going to request to take a lower dosage as I am now starting to experience headaches and nausea.  I feel like I am finally the person I always knew I was and not the bitter, angry, weepy person other people saw.""","September 20, 2009",42,Mild Side Effects,5
226799,Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had the Implanon for just over a year now, and it&#039;s been very effective in preventing pregnancy. I originally went on it because I kept forgetting to take the pill and was always paranoid. I get spotting often and light but frequent periods, which is annoying. Also, my skin isn&#039;t good these days and I believe that it&#039;s due to the Implanon. I did not gain weight, actually lost 5kgs, however I&#039;ve been eating well and exercising. I can&#039;t imagine weight gain occurring if a person is active and eating well. No change in moods - I was already irritable prior. Think I&#039;m going to have this taken out to balance my hormones.""","February 23, 2015",0,Moderate Side Effects,4

103131,Estarylla,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on this birthcontrol for 3 weeks and I feel sick all the time and nausea after I eat. I have had spotting for 2 weeks nonstop and I have not felt like myself since taking this. I also was very bloated the second week after taking Estarylla. I&#039;ve been very anxious and feel fatigued and have no appetite at all. Do not take this birth control I&#039;m not sure how good it works with preventing pregnancy but it&#039;s definitely not worth all the side effects that come with it.""","August 9, 2017",3,No Side Effects,1
113648,Acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine,Headache,"""I have severe migraines and sometimes can&#039;t afford Imitrex which is the only medication that helps me.

This was a BIG wake up call for me. I feel mentally ready to do this. So far symptoms have been nothing bad a few stomach cramps, food taste blah, a little nausea but only when I don&#039;t drink enough water. I do go to the bathroom more often about 4 times a day. I don&#039;t have cravings and I feel full. I have changed my diet big time, no carbs, fish and lean meats, lots of eggs, tons of water and small snacks throughout the day. I feel good, no tiredness like others that I read.

Taking it because of going into atrial fibrillation after lung surgery 2 years ago. I was put on Coumadin and told not to eat leafy greens. When you have had lung cancer you&#039;re supposed to eat leafy greens.  They couldn&#039;t control the highs and lows I had with Coumadin.  My only side effect is a burning feeling in my left knee to my foot but not sure it is related and am having tests done next month for circulation.""","December 28, 2011",13,Extremely Severe Side Effects,5

215311,Lubiprostone,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"""I developed Irritable Bowel Syndrome-C and chronic constipation after a C-section. I now take Amitiza 24mcg 2x per day. I&#039;ve been on it for about 10 months.  It works fantastic. I can &quot;go&quot; at least once a day now.  Amitiza draws fluid from your body to increase bowel movement (I can actually hear it working) so it is important to drink a lot of water and eat before or immediately after. I&#039;ve noticed that if I don&#039;t drink a lot of water, nausea will develop. In addition, IBS-C has caused me to change my diet and exercise. That helped a lot too. NOTE-- If the prescription costs a lot, even with insurance, Amitiza offers a discount card online.""","March 27, 2013",73,Mild Side Effects,5
