219597,Microgestin Fe 1.5 / 30,Birth Control,"""I was on Microgestin Fe 1/20 for three months prior to this, I switched because I was getting my period every two weeks. So I switched and I&#039;m so glad I did. Period is completely regulated out again like it was before I started birth control. No weight gain (actually weight loss), no mood swings, no change in libido. Worst parts of this were feeling nauseous for the first three days I was on it (nausea went away after), one pimple, and cramps the first day of my period. Overall, the pros outweigh the cons by miles, so I would recommend this to anyone!""",10-Sep-17,1,Severe Side Effects,5

I understand this medication is not going to work the same for everyone. I believe there is a short window of opportunity when you either quit or you don&#039;t. When I was down to 3 per day, I probably should have quit.  This medicine began to make me agitated, anxious and very hard to get along with, to say the least. I still smoke unfortunately.

I was diagnosed with Narcolepsy several years ago (not formally tested though). I have all the symptoms (night terrors, sleep paralysis.), but I have not been tested for it. Anyway, my Sleep Doctor put me on it primarily because of several driving issues. It seems to work well, I have not dozed off or had a zombie episode since I have been on it. I still feel tired, and I can sleep if I want to, so I feel a little more in control. I also don&#039;t feel like a speed freak, like Adderal.  I am on 200 mg in the morning for the past 2 weeks.

I actually stopped taking the medication for a few days because I was concerned I wouldn&#039;t be able to go anywhere, then started again today.  In about 30-45 minutes I was in the bathroom.

On day 6 my face started tingling. Then I noticed that things didn&#039;t taste right like coffee no longer had flavor, soda tasted funny and so on. Later that day I was trying to talk to my dad and I kept losing words, my speech was very impaired and I felt so itchy all over like fire ants were biting me.

The throwing up usually goes away in the afternoon, but sometimes I&#039;ll throw up at night or feel terrible randomly. I&#039;ve gotten cameras down my stomach, blood work done on about everything, and everything has came back NORMAL. For some reason my doctors never suggested the fact that it might be sprintec, but as of today I&#039;m going to stop taking.

The first week or so of using this cream my face felt so greasy. I just figured it was bringing oils out of the pores. During the first month my skin did burn off and on. It did not burn when I put it on, it would burn later or the following day when I would try to moisturize. The burning did get a little intense but it was totally tolerable.

MY WBC&#039;s skyrocketed, but that is typically expected due to the mechanisms by which Imbruvica works. Oversimplifying here -- the abnormal (cancerous) cells, congregate in the lymphs. Imbruvica forces those abnormal cells out into the bloodstream, where they can be attacked and starved of the BTK protein, which they need to thrive and propagate. The &quot;dead&quot; abnormal cells are then flushed out of the body.

Then I tried nadolol 20 mg/day and ramped up to 40mg/day. Within the first few weeks of being on it, migraine frequency and severity was reduced. I have been on 40 mg/day for 4 months now and have only had about one headache per month. I also have a head tremor which has reduced slightly.

It works well in these situations but my advice is to stay away from it and only take it in an emergency. I prefer lorazepam.

188753,ParaGard,Birth Control,"""When they first tried to insert the Paragard the doctor had a problem. My uterus is flipped some type of way. Anyways it took the doctor and assistant to do it. A little pain but nothing like giving birth. I do have heavier period but no bad cramps. Might be too much TMI but my Sex drive has gone up since having the Paragard because it doesn&#039;t have hormones. I was on birth control and felt so tired and lazy. I love Paragard, best birth control for me.""",8-Feb-15,34,Mild Side Effects,5
225743,Bupropion,Depression,"""When I first began this medication, it increased my suicidal thoughts but that was expected. After about 2 weeks, I began to feel better. I was more cheerful. After a month of taking the medication, I was completely happy. There are days when it does not work but that is expected. Recently, my dosage was raised from 75mg twice a day to 150 twice a day. My body is still trying to adapt to the recent increase. I am more sensitive to touch. Almost everything tickles. I don&#039;t mind it. This is a good medication. I&#039;m a little sad that I have to get off of it in July.""",12-Mar-12,33,Mild Side Effects,5
226243,Vivelle-Dot,Postmenopausal Symptoms,"""What a God send! After menopause at 50 I first thought &quot;yes! no more periods&quot; then the fun started, night sweats, hot flashes at the worst times like during business meetings, my Dr. started me on the patch .50 and within 2 days it was like a miracle - I could sleep without a towel on my pillow and the hot flashes disappeared. After a year he dropped the dose to .375 and it&#039;s still working. If you are having to fight the sweats and flashes - talk to your Dr. This stuff works!""",20-May-15,56,Mild Side Effects,5
81363,Yaz,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on Yaz since I was 23 and I&#039;m 28 now. In the first month or so I had mild side effects-felt a bit dizzy and had some breakthrough bleeding, but they subsided after a month or two. I have PMDD, and Yaz has been a Godsend in regulating my moods-instead of being out of control for 3 weeks, I only have PMDD for little less than a week.  It&#039;s definitely helped me and I&#039;d be a hot mess without it!""",6-Oct-14,18,Mild Side Effects,5
47392,Flonase,Rhinitis,"""I was getting nasal infections every 3 months that would last for weeks without treatment. I&#039;d go in and get antibiotics and within a week it&#039;d clear up. Then another 3 months later I&#039;d get another infection. UNTIL I started using this spray! As long as I continue to use it, I don&#039;t get nose infections. And, it smells like flowers, which I like. :)""",7-Apr-15,28,Mild Side Effects,5
98661,Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I tried this after experimenting off and on with pills, Depo-Provera, and barriers over the past 5 years.

Pros: Transitioning immediately from Depo-Provera to Nexplanon, I have had 0 bleeding. Convenient. Insertion was quick, easy, and I experience little pain. No need to revisit the clinic every month or three months.

Con: I have noticed some weight gain. After receiving the implant on Dec 6, it is now Jan 7 and I have gained about 3-4 lbs. This makes me a little nervous, as I feel this could easily spiral out of control quickly. I&#039;m afraid to think of what the scale will say in another month.""",7-Jan-14,5,No Side Effects,5
15818,Ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone,Birth Control,"""I&#039;m blown away by the bad reviews. However I fully believe every birth control affects people differently. This pill changed my life. I&#039;ve had bad endo since I was 13. I&#039;m 32 now. Bleeding to the point of not being able to leave the house and pain to the point a bottle of vodka was the only fix. Since I started this pill 2 years ago I haven&#039;t had a single period. No cramps! I still bloat near the end of my pack but not bad at all. No acne. Only negative side affect I think is slight unusual nausea but coming from awful endometriosis, it seriously doesn&#039;t even bug me. When I started it took a month for break through bleeding to stop. Body had to get used to it.""",31-Aug-16,6,Extremely Severe Side Effects,5
115105,Diazepam,Light Sedation,"""Very good! I use it for insomnia and I fall asleep in less than 30 mins after taking 10-15 mg. I sleep for 7 hours after that, a completely recovering sleep and I feel very good and awake the next day! I even don&#039;t need my coffee in the morning. """,24-Jan-14,16,Mild Side Effects,5
81995,Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""I have been on Sexanda now for a little over 3 weeks.  24 days to be exact.  I have lost 7 pounds to date.  The first week was awful for me.  I experienced terrible headaches, nausea, heartburn and insomnia.  I was hesitant to continue the drug as I felt terrible.  I spoke to my doctor who advised me not to up my dose the second week so I continued taking Saxenda at 0.6 for 2 weeks.  Miraculously, my side effects lessened up by the 10th day and I was happy I didn&#039;t stop.  I just increased my dose to the 1.2 and feel some nausea and a slight headache once again but no where near as bad as previously. My doctor said everyone&#039;s tolerance level is different and as long as I am losing I could go back down to .06. No need to increase if losing.""",26-Sep-16,24,Mild Side Effects,5
142531,Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,"""I used this pill years ago when I was early 20&#039;s.  Had NO side effects.  I&#039;m nervous about taking it now because I had some side effects I had with my old  BC of 3 years ago. I had severe nausea. I&#039;m too nervous to take this pill. But I know the longer I wait more my chances are of being pregnant. My Husband and I don&#039;t want anymore kids. I&#039;ll suck it up and take it.""",14-Sep-17,1,Severe Side Effects,4
132278,Ativan,Insomnia,"""I was given Ativan for occasional use. I try to use it once every week or once every ten days for sleep. (0.5mg). I&#039;m lucky that I don&#039;t have to use it any more regularly because I don&#039;t work right now. I find that it helps me relax to sleep, and I wake up feeling and looking rested. The looking rested part is important because it tells me how good it is at actually calming the anxiety. I know that when my anxiety is high, even if I sleep 10hrs, I&#039;ll wake up tired and looking tired. But I think this medicine actually does a good job of getting rid of that anxiety, so your body can rest and get into some level of &quot;deep&quot; sleep.But absolutely, really only use it on the day that you must.""",9-Aug-14,176,Moderate Side Effects,5
126842,Erythromycin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,"""This antibiotic is the best, hands down.  The Z pack doesn&#039;t even come close to this. I take this when I get really bad sinus infections that go into my chest and I start feeling better within a couple days. I specifically ask my doctor for this when I get sick because it&#039;s the one that really works.""",26-Mar-16,8,Severe Side Effects,5
68153,Plan B,Emergency Contraception,"""I took this pill on June 16th 2015. I was really scared &amp; nervous because he came in me. A week later I had some break through bleeding. I took that as a good sign that the pill is working. I got my period July 12th, which was right on time! I will say that I did become a little moody &amp; I gained some weight, but it was all worth it!""",12-Aug-15,2,Extremely Severe Side Effects,4
126865,Dilaudid,Pain,"""I developed severe pancreatitis and hepatitis due to gallstones. They tried morphine  first, but it makes me vomit even if they give me Zofran, Phenergan or Reglan with it. I&#039;m allergic to many medications and latex. My only previous experience with painkillers was codeine for a severe cough and Percocet for a gynecological issue. I had an anaphylactic reaction to the Percocet. Not fun. So they decided to try Dilaudid on me - at least if I had a bad reaction to it, they could treat me immediately. I was so grateful! Complete pain relief and no vomiting. No side effects either nor like I was on anything, it just made the pain stop. IV Dilaudid worked within 30 seconds. They gave me pills to take home, the pills take about 30 minutes.""",2-Feb-10,58,Mild Side Effects,5
40841,Leuprolide,Endometriosis,"""lupron is not for everyone! I must admit I was horrified to try it, but it came a point I would rather die so had nothing to lose. In 2011 and 2012 both 9 months each. Then after treatment was birth control ( levora) high dose. Now 2015 just started having severe pain uncontrolled by anything else so started Lipton injection yesterday. This med made me forget I had the disease. I&#039;m not saying there could be long term issues or anything else. But right now in this moment I&#039;m not sick and every time before it was a god send. Hopeful this time will be as smooth as last couple times. Good luck.""",26-Aug-15,17,Moderate Side Effects,5
