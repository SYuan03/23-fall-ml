I have no doubt that most obesity is caused from sugar/carb addiction, which is just as powerful as any drug.

I really don&#039;t care to eat; it&#039;s just to fill my stomach. Since I have only been on it a few days, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ve lost weight (I don&#039;t have a scale), but my clothes do feel a little looser, so maybe a pound or two.

The hospital said to stop eating anything from 1pm on the Wednesday and recommended (giving some detail) a non fibre diet from Tuesday evening until Wednesday noon - avoiding dark drinks and jelly (like blackcurrant flavour). Avoid red meat, sausages and pies; fruit, vegetables and salad; potato skins or fries, wholemeal or brown bread; nuts, pulses, baked beans; wholemeal pasta, brown rice; puddings containing fruit or nuts; cakes and biscuits, yoghurts. Preferred are white skinless meat like chicken, grilled or poached fish, cheese, eggs; white bread, pasta, rice; boiled or mashed potatoes, water, fizzy drinks, fruit squash (not blackcurrant), clear soups, tea or coffee, shredless marmalade or jam, ice cream, custard, clear jelly, butter, margarine. 

The hospital also instructed me to start taking Moviprep, one packet (A + B) at 7pm Wednesday evening; and then another packet (A+B) starting from 6am Thursday. On each occasion I was told to drink the mixture at 250ml a time over 1 to 2 hours. On each occasion I was also to take 500ml of clear water AND to take some sugary drinks to maintain blood sugar levels &ndash; non-diet carbonated drinks i.e. Coca Cola, Lucozade, or ginger ale, any other clear sugary fluids such as clear apple juice (but NOT other fruit juices); water alone not being sufficient. A spoonful of honey is suggested if sugary drinks are not liked.

On Wednesday evening I mixed the two Moviprep packets (A + B) with 1 litre of water in a large jug. It tasted mildly of lemon but, because of warnings about taste, I downed each 250ml in seconds (rather than sip it) so as not to have to agonise over the taste. Starting at 7am the fourth dose was finished at 8pm. The drug started having an effect at about 7.45pm and thereafter it was a matter of getting to the lavatory frequently and quickly for about 3 to 4 hours. I went to bed at midnight but had to get up again at 2am and two more occasions up to 4am; though not in so much of a hurry. I took the 500ml of water after the final dose and about 250ml of Lucozade after that.  I was also told to use, what we in the UK, call vaseline to prevent soreness of skin on the buttocks. This I did not do but regretted it. Just before midnight I was so sore that I did apply some vaseline ready for Thursday morning and it paid dividends. 

On Thursday morning I went through the same procedure again applying the vaseline again before starting. This time the emissions were yellow and eventually pretty clear. Also the emissions pretty much (though not entirely) finished by 8am, much quicker than the night before. I can only assume there was nothing left to eject.

I wasn&#039;t concerned about any redness in my skin, as it wasn&#039;t bad, but I was assured it would take care of the pimple-like bumps that had persisted for years.  I tried it for two weeks and there was no improvement.....just got a little worse.  It also dried out my skin, so had to use extra moisturizers. No terrible side effects, so rating it a 2.

The rapidity of action is due to the unique way it works; it isn&#039;t the typical antidepressant.

Wellbutrin has side effects, but none harsh enough to stop me from taking it regular. The side effects I experience is (a.) a tense feeling (physically), and (b.) kind of a &#039;chemical taste&#039; in my mouth.

One of my least favorite things about this medicine is that, although it clears most of my clogged pores, I have noticed an increase in painful cystic acne around hotspots (potentially due to the onset of hormonal acne).""","July 16, 2016",2,Moderate Side Effects,2

35637,Buprenorphine / naloxone,Opiate Dependence,"""My personal experience with suboxone is good so far. I have been on prescribed Fentanyl Patch 25 much/ 48 hrs. I have dropped to this dose over the last year. (I also left the old patch on). I have been on opiates for 12 years full time prescribed. At my highest prescription I was using 180mg of Oxycodone and 180 mg of morphine per day. I have had several adjustments on medicine including extended release doses. 5 years ago I was put on 50 mug of Fanta to with 3-10 mg Oxys per day for breakthrough. I started leaving my old patches on to increase my daily dose. This last year I tapered Down to 25 mcg patches for 48 hours.( still leaving my old patches on.) I went to a doctor that prescribes Suboxone. Lucky for me my insurance pays for Suboxone. He gave me the 8/2 mg strips. I take 1/2 a strip twice a day. I was checking every forum to see how long I needed to wait to start the suboxone. The replies are all very different. Some say 16 hours, most day 24. Others say 48-36-72 hours. Yikes! How do I keep out of precipitated withdrawals! I already have withdrawals every other day on my patch!... so I removed my patch last night around 5 pm. (I already have my suboxone script at home. ) so I started feeling withdrawal symptoms coming on around 11 pm. They didn&#039;t get super intense. I checked the cows scale as many articles suggested but only scored mild.. had the stretching of limbs symptom, anxiety.. so I took a half of a strip which was the suggested dose. I took it at 12 noon today. That&#039;s only 19-20 hours. I was in withdrawals, but not the worst I have ever had. I was scared of the precipitated withdrawals I heard about. 10-15 minutes after I took it, I felt a hot sensation wash over me. Thought I would get those withdrawals, but I took a quick bath, laid down for an hour and. Is I feel pretty good. Took my withdrawals away. I still have some muscle pain, but not the kind that come from withdrawals. Suboxone stopped the withdrawals right away. No headaches or sick feeling. Not high, but even my regular dose meds haven&#039;t made me high for years... so if your guessing on when it&#039;s ok to take suboxone after opiates, and fentanyl seems to be the highest strength, then I day shoot for 24 hours. If you are not in withdrawals at 24, then wait until you are.. if you are in withdrawals before 24 hours then just wait as long as you can. You will know when it&#039;s too bad to wait anymore. You know your body... you can always take half the amount prescribed and see how it reacts if your are afraid of precipitated withdrawals. Trust me, it will stop the withdrawals within a half hour. I have not gotten the precipices withdrawals so far. Hope this helps someone. Good luck to you!""","May 27, 2017",24,Mild Side Effects,5

My depression became so severe last Oct. that I had to go back on to an anti-depressant (Bupropion) but this medication made my depression much worse.  I was then put onto Trintellix in April.  The Trintellix was helpful, but side effects soon began to appear.  

I happened upon an article about a psychiatrist who had used niacin for treating depression.   When I googled niacin and depression, I came upon many other blogs and comments from other people who also found niacin to be effective against their struggles with depression. 

 I was desperate to find an alternative to taking anti-depressants, so 4 weeks ago, I began supplementing with niacin plus vitamin C.   (I had already been taking a vitamin B multi, magnesium, fish oil and Vit. D).  I started with 100mcg niacin and have been gradually increasing the dose by 25mcg increments each day.  I use only the regular niacin, not the timed release nor the non-flushing type.

Since I started taking the additional niacin &amp; vitamin C,  I find that my depression is/has diminished significantly.

TRY THIS! It will work! If for some reason it doesn&#039;t, try something else! GET HELP NOW!

After being diagnosed bipolar 2, he suggested another med. I strongly advocated for Lamictal. I tapered up to 200mg, on a conservative schedule. I&#039;ve had good results over the past 9 months. It definitely has lowered the instances of hypomania, or at least deescalated the intensity. It&#039;s done little to address the depression or anxiety, so we&#039;ve agreed to add anti-depressant. Again, he suggested Cymbalta, which I opposed due to the all the information regarding withdrawal syndrome.

My periods were so heavy though and without realizing it I think I became severely anemic.  I had it removed and within 2 weeks started to feel alive and normal again.

My mood and motivation stay good, but it feels like I need to take a nap mid-afternoon or sleep an extra hour or two. For me, this isn&#039;t acceptable long-term.

I went to a neurologist, and he changed my script to Mirapex. The 1st night was wonderful, the next full day, I was sleepy. 

He had put me on 0.5 tabs 3x a day. I found that if I cut a tab into quarters, I could take 1/4 during the day with miminal sleepiness, and 1/2 tab at night when I wanted to sleep real good. So I end up taking the pill just 2x a day.""","March 14, 2013",55,No Side Effects,5

I do not have any period symptoms at all now except a hair trigger temper on the last 2 pills (which coincides with my weekend, so I let my family know not to bother me). After a year this has calmed down though to where its almost not noticeable anymore. There are so many pros to this medicine that having a bad temper for 2 days a month is definitely worth it.

Your body handles this infection with all it&#039;s defenses so you SHOULD expect to feel really icky for about a week.  
I am floored at today&#039;s rush in society to get everything done right now or right away.  Every body needs time to heal and recover.  Allow yourself the precious gift of rest and recuperating it needs and unless you begin to spike fever or experience allergic reaction,  hang in there and know it&#039;s okay to take some time off to nurture you.""","October 21, 2016",25,Moderate Side Effects,5

145957,Suboxone,Opiate Dependence,"""My personal experience with suboxone is good so far. I have been on prescribed Fentanyl Patch 25 much/ 48 hrs. I have dropped to this dose over the last year. (I also left the old patch on). I have been on opiates for 12 years full time prescribed. At my highest prescription I was using 180mg of Oxycodone and 180 mg of morphine per day. I have had several adjustments on medicine including extended release doses. 5 years ago I was put on 50 mug of Fanta to with 3-10 mg Oxys per day for breakthrough. I started leaving my old patches on to increase my daily dose. This last year I tapered Down to 25 mcg patches for 48 hours.( still leaving my old patches on.) I went to a doctor that prescribes Suboxone. Lucky for me my insurance pays for Suboxone. He gave me the 8/2 mg strips. I take 1/2 a strip twice a day. I was checking every forum to see how long I needed to wait to start the suboxone. The replies are all very different. Some say 16 hours, most day 24. Others say 48-36-72 hours. Yikes! How do I keep out of precipitated withdrawals! I already have withdrawals every other day on my patch!... so I removed my patch last night around 5 pm. (I already have my suboxone script at home. ) so I started feeling withdrawal symptoms coming on around 11 pm. They didn&#039;t get super intense. I checked the cows scale as many articles suggested but only scored mild.. had the stretching of limbs symptom, anxiety.. so I took a half of a strip which was the suggested dose. I took it at 12 noon today. That&#039;s only 19-20 hours. I was in withdrawals, but not the worst I have ever had. I was scared of the precipitated withdrawals I heard about. 10-15 minutes after I took it, I felt a hot sensation wash over me. Thought I would get those withdrawals, but I took a quick bath, laid down for an hour and. Is I feel pretty good. Took my withdrawals away. I still have some muscle pain, but not the kind that come from withdrawals. Suboxone stopped the withdrawals right away. No headaches or sick feeling. Not high, but even my regular dose meds haven&#039;t made me high for years... so if your guessing on when it&#039;s ok to take suboxone after opiates, and fentanyl seems to be the highest strength, then I day shoot for 24 hours. If you are not in withdrawals at 24, then wait until you are.. if you are in withdrawals before 24 hours then just wait as long as you can. You will know when it&#039;s too bad to wait anymore. You know your body... you can always take half the amount prescribed and see how it reacts if your are afraid of precipitated withdrawals. Trust me, it will stop the withdrawals within a half hour. I have not gotten the precipices withdrawals so far. Hope this helps someone. Good luck to you!""","May 27, 2017",24,Mild Side Effects,5

I had slight hand tremors for about a year after starting this, which was annoying but not incapacitating. They are gone now. I also gained about 10 pounds during the first few months, but lost it easily and I am now lighter than when I started. People used to tell me: Oh you&#039;ll gain so much weight, but it is mostly water weight because you get very thirsty. Overall, my quality of life is much, much better.

In the last 5yrs, IBS-c symptoms are the most prevalent. Recently, I experienced SEVERE constipation (nearly 8+ days). I was terribly bloated, my abdomin was distended, had gas pains (under each side of my rib cage), and even chest pains. 

I took dulcolax for women at the onset of this situation. It barely worked. It did however cause me to curl up in the fetal position on a hotel floor room (I was traveling for business) for over 2.5hrs while grabbing my stomach in agony due to the severe cramping it caused. Cold sweats and crying out for my mom (at 33yrs old) accompanied the pain. 

So imagine my hesitation when my parents urged me to take M.O.M. while visiting for the holiday. 
Even with the fear of being curled up on the bathroom floor in my childhood home- I gave into my concerned parents recommendation of taking M.O.M. 
Night 1 - I was scared of cramping (even though the label clearly states - stimulant &amp; cramp free) so I only took 45ml vs. 60ml prior to bed. 
I woke up and had success! Multiple BM&#039;s but still felt (knew) I was constipated. 
Night 2 - knowing I had not successfully passed everything- I took 60ml prior to bed.

Average fasting BS went from 280&#039;s to 110&#039;s. I wish I could stay on this forever as it has worked great for me, but I&#039;m sure the discount card program will end at some point.

However, the seizures have got worse since taking the keppra plus the side effects are awful. At the start I was so tired I spent all day asleep.

While being on it (after the initial 6 wk period), the only time I really suffered from anxiety was in situations where any NORMAL person would start getting anxious and it never escalated to the point of tears and having to lock myself in a bathroom.

As for the depression, it helped a lot but after 18 months of being on the maximum dose, I guess my body has built up a tolerance to it and I now need to change over to something else. I&#039;ve gone back to crying every day. Was great while it lasted.""","June 21, 2011",6,No Side Effects,5

It goes to show how severely inadequate and ignorant our health care system is when it comes to women and this debilitating disease. Birth control does not fix endo. It does not cure it. The ONLY treatment that has a chance of curing endo is expert excision surgery by a skilled surgeon.  Laparoscopy is just a diagnostic tool. Not a treatment. Birth control can help some of the symptoms for some women. But it does nothing to actually fix it. Please ladies, ask questions, research your disease.

I kept getting surges of pain randomly that felt so deep inside to the point where I debated all night on going to the ER. The cream to soothe the burning and itching made it worse.

DO NOT scrub your face which stimulates sebum production. Use your finger tips and be as gentle as possible washing face AM/PM daily.
When starting retinoids/ Epiduo, apply at night after washing and let face dry 20min. Apply 50/50 with Cetaphil eczema sensitive skin moisturizer. If you skin is red skip a night but I found that this moisturizer will eliminate the redness.

My skin other than my acne zones was soft and smooth but nothing was treating the actual problem on my cheeks. I decided to change my birth control.
