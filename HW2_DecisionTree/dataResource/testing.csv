219597,Microgestin Fe 1.5 / 30,Birth Control,"""I was on Microgestin Fe 1/20 for three months prior to this, I switched because I was getting my period every two weeks. So I switched and I&#039;m so glad I did. Period is completely regulated out again like it was before I started birth control. No weight gain (actually weight loss), no mood swings, no change in libido. Worst parts of this were feeling nauseous for the first three days I was on it (nausea went away after), one pimple, and cramps the first day of my period. Overall, the pros outweigh the cons by miles, so I would recommend this to anyone!""",10-Sep-17,1,Severe Side Effects,

The nausea lasted for about 20 minutes after each dose and got better over time.  The vivid dreams, constipation, and gas got worse. I understand this medication is not going to work the same for everyone. I believe there is a short window of opportunity when you either quit or you don&#039;t. When I was down to 3 per day, I probably should have quit.  This medicine began to make me agitated, anxious and very hard to get along with, to say the least. I still smoke unfortunately.

I was diagnosed with Narcolepsy several years ago (not formally tested though). I have all the symptoms (night terrors, sleep paralysis.), but I have not been tested for it. Anyway, my Sleep Doctor put me on it primarily because of several driving issues. It seems to work well, I have not dozed off or had a zombie episode since I have been on it. I still feel tired, and I can sleep if I want to, so I feel a little more in control. I also don&#039;t feel like a speed freak, like Adderal.  I am on 200 mg in the morning for the past 2 weeks.

I actually stopped taking the medication for a few days because I was concerned I wouldn&#039;t be able to go anywhere, then started again today.  In about 30-45 minutes I was in the bathroom.

On day 6 my face started tingling. Then I noticed that things didn&#039;t taste right like coffee no longer had flavor, soda tasted funny and so on. Later that day I was trying to talk to my dad and I kept losing words, my speech was very impaired and I felt so itchy all over like fire ants were biting me.

I&#039;ve gotten cameras down my stomach, blood work done on about everything, and everything has came back NORMAL. For some reason my doctors never suggested the fact that it might be sprintec, but as of today I&#039;m going to stop taking.

I used to feel tired every day with an awful &quot;hangover&quot; feeling - and I really haven&#039;t had a day like that since. I take 50 micrograms each morning before I go for a 30 minute walk. I wait another 30 minutes before eating breakfast, and I don&#039;t take any vitamins until I&#039;ve eaten lunch.

I unfortunately had issues with severe acne before taking this pill and it made it a lot worse for me. It went from just being on my face to all over my body by the 5th week.
